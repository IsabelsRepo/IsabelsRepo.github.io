Downtown Cincinnati. He was driving his 2005 blue Toyota Camry KY/578JWF. His wife, Siang Hlei Par, was in the
passenger seat and they were the only occupants of the vehicle. Mr. Nung was shot while in traffic. He was
transported to local hospital and was pronounced deceased at 8:16pm on July 26, 2017. Homicide Detectives interviewed
wife, Mrs. Par, shortly after the shooting. She and her husband are Bermese immigrants and she speaks only a little
English. She was able to tell us that she did not hear any horns blowing or her husband making any sudden turns, leading
us to believe this was not a ""road rage"" incident. Several witnesses at the scene heard gunshots or what they later
determined to be gunshots but no one saw a shooter. Video from a public transportation bus ""Tank"" bus was recovered
and this video contains audio as well as visual documentation of the the victim's vehicle. The video shows the lane of
travel the victim was in and it documented the speed the bus the traveling, approximately 6MPH. The bus was about 5
cars ahead of the victim and the video is from each side of the bus. The audio picks up 2 gunshots, first gunshot sounds
different than the second in pitch. Both gunshots are consecutive of each other. Immediately after the shots are heard you
can see the victim strike the vehicle in front of him then his vehicle drives off to the right, coming to rest at the guardrail.
Victim's vehicle sustained driver's side window damage. Glass was shattered after his removal from the car by
paramedics. No evidence of the second bullet was observed or recovered either from the victim, his car , or the surrounding area. A search of the area was unable to
produce any shell casings or otherwise determine the origin of the shots. This area is congested with on and off ramps to
various parts of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. At the time of this shooting the Brent Spence bridge that connects
Ohio and Kentucky was under construction and there were heavy traffic back ups. We have consulted with two firearms
examiners in the Hamilton County lab and all they had to examine were very little bullet fragments and copper jacketing
fragments that were recovered from the victim and the victim's vehicle. They are unable to see any marking on the tiny
fragments recovered. Several canvasses and examinations of the area have lead us to believe that the shot couldn't have
come from any buildings in the area. The most likely scenario is the shot was fired from an adjacent ramp that leads to
eastbound Fort Washington Way. Due to the height of the ramp and angle needed to make the shot and it could not have
come from a sedan or a low riding vehicle.",, Black, Brown,, 12/14/1988," 5'05""",125,,39.10184,-84.51969,Cincinnati,                Ohio,2-6
