# Welcome!  
Hello and [Welcome!](https://isabelsrepo.github.io/2022/08/01/Welcome-Post.html)
I'm glad you found my projects. I am a biogeochemist and I like to use python to help me investigate data. I have a few projects I've been working on that you might want to take a look at.  

## Unsolved Homicides
### Acquiring the data
I collected some publicly available data on unsolved homicides in the Cincinnati area and I'm the process of analyzing that data. I have a brief post on [how I collected](https://isabelsrepo.github.io/scraping-unsolved-homicide-data/) the data and I'm currently writing a couple posts on some trends I noticed while looking at the data. 

### Cleaning the data
In my last post I discussed scraping data about unsolved homicides. [Here](https://isabelsrepo.github.io/unsolved-homicide-data-cleaning/), I discuss some of the challenges I encountered cleaning that data and briefly describe my overall thought process and approach. By the end I have data that I'll use in a follow up post to create a map and some charts that help highlight some trends in the data.

### Analysis
[This](https://github.com/IsabelsRepo/IsabelsRepo.github.io/blob/main/_posts/2022-08-01_Unsolved_Homicide_Analysis.md)  is the probably the last post in a series of posts about my [collection](https://isabelsrepo.github.io/scraping-unsolved-homicide-data/), [cleaning](https://isabelsrepo.github.io/unsolved-homicide-data-cleaning/), and analysis of Unsolved Homicide data for the Cincinnati area. In the last post, I left off after briefly describing some of the cleaning I preformed on the data and described some of the data I added. Using this mostly clean data I created a few charts to demonstrate some of the trends in the data.
