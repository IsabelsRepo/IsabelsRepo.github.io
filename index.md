# Welcome!  
Hello and Welcome!
I'm glad you found my projects. I am a biogeochemist and I like to use python to help me investigate data. I have a few projects I've been working on that you might want to take a look at.  

## Unsolved Homicides
### Acquiring the data
I collected some publicly available data on unsolved homicides in the Cincinnati area and I'm the process of analyzing that data. I have a brief post on [how I collected](https://github.com/IsabelsRepo/IsabelsRepo.github.io/blob/main/Unsolved-Scraper-post.md) the data and I'm currently writing a couple posts on some trends I noticed while looking at the data. 

### Cleaning the data
In my last post I discussed scraping data about unsolved homicides. [Here](https://github.com/IsabelsRepo/IsabelsRepo.github.io/blob/main/2022-07-26-Unsolved-Homicide-Data-Cleaning.md), I discuss some of the challenges I encountered cleaning that data and briefly describe my overall thought process and approach. By the end I have data that I'll use in a follow up post to create a map and some charts that help highlight some trends in the data.

### Analysis
This post will discuss some of the trends in the unsolved homicide data.
