# Welcome!  
Hello and Welcome!
I'm glad you found my projects. I am a biogeochemist and I like to use python to help me investigate data. I have a few projects I've been working on that you might want to take a look at.  

## Unsolved Homicides
I collected some publicly available data on unsolved homicides in the Cincinnati area and I'm the process of analyzing that data. I have a brief post on how I collected the data and I'm currently writing a couple posts on some trends I noticed while looking at the data.
